## Backgrounds

#### Inspired by Minecraft, want to make a framework based on plug-in . 

#### Framework must be used to solve a particular problem in the field of this framework is used to solve the problem of micro service classes

## Introduction

#### A simple progressive framework, to provide you with similar Bukkit development experience of the project mainly can be used to develop Web page background also can be used as a game

## What can be done

#### Rapid iteration functionality through plug-ins (that is often said that **the micro service**) through the command and plug-in can realize the function of rapid development to avoid repetition and start SpringBoot time

## History

#### Was for netease MINECRAFT HyCraft backend, later for Pubsher currently for PVPIN Studio background of the development

## Modules

#### We use such as apis, commands module in isolation and we provided based on the function of the module can even stronger than SpringBoot itself

## Plugin

### You can use any language to develop plug-ins, based on the Jvm we have Java and Kotlin recommended. Anyway, please remember not to use SpringBoot instead of itself, because SpringBoot thing after the plug-in uninstall would have residual, this is a very serious problem. Framework provides a powerful Api: FrameData AutoSaveRepository... Of course, you can also use our event system. Detailed information will be referred to in the tutorial
